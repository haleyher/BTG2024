This disparity is indicative of a massive class and race divide in the city, and the goal of our financial mentorship program is to close it. We allow our users to connect with students at world class business schools and undergraduate finance programs and employees at leading commercial banks and wealth/asset management firms in the form of financial literacy workshops, one-on-one consultations, and even long term mentorships-- all for free. Here, you can browse our available opportunities and find the one that best suits your needs.</p>
