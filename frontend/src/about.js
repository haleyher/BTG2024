          hello
          <br></br> <br></br>In conjunction with our hardware, our website can provide users with new coding ideas.
          Number of people working on a project and amount of time available are taken into account to provide projects with corresponding difficulty.
          
          </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
  
        <p className="textSection">
          We hope to increase Computer Science engagement, specifically in middle school kids. <br></br><br></br>
          
          The first hurdle most people have to combat is ideation. As STEM Mentors, we encourage young students to jump right into a project, instead of getting stuck on creating the "perfect idea". </p>
